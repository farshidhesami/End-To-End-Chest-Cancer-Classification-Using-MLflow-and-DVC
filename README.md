### Create a template.py :

- For logging.basicConfig(filename='app.log', level=logging.INFO) for more information Go to website : https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html .

- Add a ".github/workflows/.gitkeep", in code because Git does not track empty directories by default, so adding a `.gitkeep` file is a common workaround
  to this.the `.gitkeep` file is not a built-in feature of Git. It's just a convention that many developers use.

- open a terminal and write a "python template.py" and check the app.log file is created or not.
